## Description
This tool is for personal use, to speed up my end-of-month settlement process.  

It is my first time using Python.  
I made this project to learn and practice the grammar and structure of Python from the scratch.

## Process Description
1. Input: Get the whole daily data of a month as text
2. Parse: Parse by each line and store the values as properly
3. Compose: Compose all stored values to formatted text
4. Output: Print the composed text

## Getting Started
Run the program and paste a whole `daily text` of a month to the console.  
(need a newline at the end of input)

It returns converted data into a `CSV` file.  
You can manage the setting of the output file in `resources/config.yml`.  
You can also modify the base digit of current currency, or the list of keywords.

The output file consists of two-part, `keyword part` and `memo part`.
